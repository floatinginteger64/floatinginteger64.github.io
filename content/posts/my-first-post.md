Hello world
## Go
Go is simple, concise and to the point. It is extremely clean and is performant enough.
TL;DR: Go is awesome

```go
import "fmt"
func main(){
  fmt.Println("Hello World!")
}
```

## Python
##### Indents are stupid
There are numerous ways to write a helloworld in python. I hate python's syntax, but everything in machine learning is being done in it, so here goes nothing

```Python
print("The syntax is stupid, but the language is fun nonetheless")
```

## C
Ahh, C. I love it.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
  printf("Ol' but gold\n");
  return 0;
}
